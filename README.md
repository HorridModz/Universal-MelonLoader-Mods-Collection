# MelonLoader-UniversalMods

I decided to compile all the universal [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) mods I could find into one folder for easy access. I haven't tested the majority of these. For help or questions, go to their Github repositories (see [#Mods](#mods)). Only ask me if you notice a mistake in *this repository*.

Before using a mod, make sure to check its **README** for instructions.

# Official Universal Mods Index

Find the official list of universal MelonLoader mods in the [MelonLoader Wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/universalmods). However, this repository has all the mods there and additional mods, so you shouldn't need to go there.

# Mods

## UnityExplorer

An in-game UI for exploring, debugging and modifying Unity games.

* Github Repository: [UnityExplorer - Github](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer)

## CoreLimiter

A mod to automatically limit your game to a certain amount of CPU cores. This can be used to boost performance on some Ryzen CPUs by limiting the game to a single CCX. Naturally, limiting the game may reduce maximum possible performance under heavy load, and results are highly dependent on how well the game is multithreaded.

## HWIDPatch

This mod allows you to fake your Hardware ID. This mod creates a new ID on launch and saves it for future launches. The ID can be changed in `modprefs.ini` afterwards. Set it to empty string to generate a new one.  
Privacy first!

## LocalPlayerPrefs

This mod moves game settings storage from Windows registry to UserData folder.  
This can make using multiple game installs easier by having them not share the same space in the registry.

## NoSteamAtAll

Makes the game unable to access Steam. At all.  
Naturally, this will break all game features dependent on steam (for example logins/user accounts, multiplayer, leaderboards, achievements).  
Intended for games that don't really need steam, but might abuse it for data collection/targeting/other suspicious activities.

## RuntimeGraphicsSettings

A mod to allow tweaking some graphics settings at runtime to get those extra few frames.  
Works best when your game has an in-game UI for mod settings (as another mod, naturally).

## FrameFocus

FrameFocus is a computer performance enhancement game utility. This will allow you to gain a slight bit of performance while you are tabbed out of the game. When you are tabbed out, your frame rate will drop (this is to unfocusing the game, thus causing extra performance through out your computer). Once you tab back in, your frame rate will go back to normal. This mod also doubles as a frame rate unlocker of sorts. You can set a max target frame rate you would like the game to try and run at.
