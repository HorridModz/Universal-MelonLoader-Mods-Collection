## LocalPlayerPrefs
This mod moves game settings storage from Windows registry to UserData folder.  
This can make using multiple game installs easier by having them not share the same space in the registry.  
Do note that some settings will stay in registry (the ones that Unity itself uses as opposed to game code).  
There's also no import from registry, so any data/settings stored there will need to be configured anew after installing this mod.
